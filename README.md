# __leetcode__

This repository is meant to house some leetcode solutions I've come 
up with. The solutions aren't always new: the approach isn't 
always fundementally different from those used to surface known 
solutions. This applies especially to classic problems like preorder 
traversal. As a new devotee of test-driven development I also include 
tests to the extent possible, though not always for earlier algorithms

## Purpose
__Goal__: provide a stock of core algorithm components for future projects 

Algorithms that are written in Python and Java or C are repeated for the sake
or reinforcement 

## Please challenge these solutions
This project welcomes suggestions and contributions! Please challenge these solutions, poke holes in them, use them for other open source projects, indicate where
there are redundant lines of code, and likewise with tests. The tests
are deliberately reundant although __all__ comments and feedback 
are appreciated, including those about verbose tests
