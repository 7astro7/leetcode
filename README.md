# __leetcode__

This repository is meant to house some leetcode solutions I've come 
up with. The solutions aren't always new and the approach isn't 
always fundementally different from those used to surface known 
solutions. This applies especially to classic problems like preorder 
traversal. As a new devotee of test-driven development 
I also include tests to the extent possible although not always. 

## Please challenge these solutions
Please challenge these solutions, poke holes in them, indicate where
there are redundant lines of code, and likewise with tests. The tests
are deliberately quite reundant although __all__ comments and feedback 
are appreciated.
